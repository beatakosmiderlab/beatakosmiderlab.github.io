Our research is focused on two broad and complementary areas of research. First, we develop computational infrastructure and machine learning approaches for large-scale biomedical data science. Second, we use data science methods to advance precision cancer treatment by analyzing molecular datasets to predict tumor response to therapy and mechanisms of resistance.
